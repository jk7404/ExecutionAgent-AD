# Tools

    2. read_file: Read a file.
        Example: {"command": {"name": "read_file", "args": {"file_path": "python.py"}}}
    3. write_to_file: Write text into a file. args: (filename: string, text: string).
    4. search_docker_image: You can use this tool to search for docker images that are published on docker hub. This would allow you to obtain some images that are not basic. For example, ubuntu images that have java8 and maven... The tool would yield a list of images names and the description. You can use those names when creating a docker image or a dockerfile.
    Example: {"command": {"name": "search_docker_image", "args": {"search_term": "jdk8 maven mysql"}}}
