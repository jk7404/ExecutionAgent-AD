Feedback from previous attempts:
- Use an Updated Dockerfile: Modify the Dockerfile to use FROM node:18-slim right from the start to ensure the environment is set up with the correct Node.js version.

- Manual Installation Verification: After each command that installs Node.js, verify the installed version immediately with node -v to confirm the correct version has been set.

- Alternative Node.js Installations: If nvm continues to fail, use the NodeSource script directly or consider using n (another Node.js version manager) if it can be installed successfully.

- Check for Residual Packages: Before attempting a new installation of Node.js, ensure that all previous installations are completely purged, including any residual packages.

- Logging and Error Checking: Include checks and logs after critical commands to catch any errors or issues immediately, aiding in faster troubleshooting.
