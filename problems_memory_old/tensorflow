Feedback from previous attempts:
- Isolate Environment Setup:

    Create the virtual environment outside the TensorFlow source directory at the outset.
    Avoid navigating into the TensorFlow source tree for dependency installations to prevent import conflicts.

- Dependency Installation:

    Specify exact dependency versions, especially for numpy and tensorflow, as compatibility issues often arise with their latest versions.
    Use a requirements file with pinned versions to ensure consistency across installs.

- Running Tests:

    Run tests strictly from outside the source directory to avoid ImportErrors.
    Use the command pytest /path/to/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests from outside the TensorFlow source directory to prevent circular import errors.
