Feedback from previous attempts:
- This project requires Node 18
- This project requires pnpm
- Clear Package Caches: Ensure all Node.js-related packages and their configurations are fully removed by clearing apt and npm caches, and confirming no residual configurations (rm -rf ~/.npm and apt-get clean).

- Direct Download and Install of Node.js: Instead of NodeSource or apt, consider downloading Node.js 18.x directly from the official website, extracting it, and linking it manually.

- Use a Pre-built Node.js 18.x Base Image: Start from a Docker base image that already includes Node.js 18.x (e.g., node:18-slim) to avoid dependency conflicts and streamline setup.

- Ensure Compatible npm Version: Confirm compatibility of installed npm with the required pnpm version before proceeding with pnpm install.
