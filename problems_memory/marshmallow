### Feedback from previous installation attempts

From the detailed information provided:

1. **Project is a Python Package**: The project directory contains various documentation files, a source code directory, and tests directory indicating that the project is properly structured. It's crucial to maintain this structure for successful building and testing.

2. **Dependencies Missing in Installation**: Dependencies such as 'tox', 'pytest', 'simplejson', 'sphinx', and 'packaging' were identified but it's not clear whether they were properly installed before running tests. Missing dependencies could lead to a build failure. Always ensure to install all required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Tox Failure**: The command to run tests with `tox` failed because the `tox` tool was not found. This is likely due to either an incomplete installation of dependencies or a path issue. Make sure `tox` is properly installed in the environment, and that the environment path is set correctly. 

4. **Marshmallow Dependency**: Marshmallow is a critical dependency identified in the project files. Make sure it's correctly installed using the command `pip install -U marshmallow`, else it could result in operational issues.

To rectify these, in the next attempt:
- Ensure all dependencies in 'requirements.txt' are properly installed.
- Confirm that 'tox' is installed and the environment path is set correctly.
- Secure successful installation of 'marshmallow'. 

Running tests after these corrections should be successful.
