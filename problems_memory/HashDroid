### Feedback from previous installation attempts

1. **Gradle Wrapper Missing:** The project attempts to use the Gradle Wrapper, but the required `gradlew` script is missing. This means the project is not fully set up to use the Gradle Wrapper, which is a best practice for ensuring that all builds use the same Gradle version.

2. **Gradle Version Incompatibility:** The current Gradle version (4.4.1) is incompatible with the version required by the project (5.1.1). This incompatibility is causing the build to fail. 

3. **Gradle Wrapper Configuration Issues:** Attempts to set up the Gradle Wrapper and specify the correct version in the gradle-wrapper.properties file were unsuccessful.

   Resolutions:
   
   - Add the missing Gradle Wrapper script files to the project. These typically include the `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` scripts alongside the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` file.

   - Update the project's Gradle version to match the required version (5.1.1). This can be done in the gradle-wrapper.properties file within the Gradle Wrapper directory.

   - Ensure that the Gradle Wrapper has been correctly set up in the project. This can typically be done using the `gradle wrapper` command with the desired Gradle version, e.g., `gradle wrapper --gradle-version=5.1.1`.

Carefully following these steps should solve the critical issues faced in previous installation attempts, allowing the HashDroid project to build and run successfully.
