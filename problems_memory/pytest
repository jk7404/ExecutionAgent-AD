### Feedback from previous installation attempts

1. The initial setup and installation of the 'pytest' project seem to be successful with all the important dependencies correctly extracted. However, it is important to note that there is confusion between 'webpack' and 'pytest'. As per the request, the 'webpack' project was to be installed but all actions and results are related to 'pytest'.
   
2. Another issue is running pip as the root user, which is considered a bad practice. The warning suggests using a virtual environment, which helps in isolating the environment to prevent conflicts between different version of packages.

3. In the later stages, the 'tox' command was not found which indicates that it may not have been installed or is not available in the current environment. This was corrected in a subsequent step by installing 'tox'.

For the next attempt, ensure that:

- The correct project ('webpack' vs 'pytest') is being installed.
- Utilize a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies 
- Verify that all necessary testing tools like 'tox' are installed before running test cases.
